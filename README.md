# threads and standard library

C11 &lt;threads.h&gt;, standard lib implementation, etc.

You'll find the following items here:
1. [A brief explanation](threads/README.md) on the threads directory
2. [Exhaustive overview](threads/threads.md) on pretty much everything related to synchronization and threads.
3. [Actual implementation](threads/threads.h) for C11â€”C23 threads and mechanisms (still in progress)
4. [Mechanism classification](threads/mech.md) on groups of mechanisms, and the plan I originally made, in regards to working w/ synchronization in specific use cases, and other mechanisms in context.

There's a couple things you should know first. This isnt a library that uses POSIX threads. It is for C11 threads, and is quite extensive and ambitious, in regards to the amount of areas it covers, which again, you should really read the [exhaustive overview](threads/threads.md) as well as the other documents, to get a clear picture of just how in depth it is. It also goes beyond the exhaustive explanation too, seeing as I incoporate custom process synchronization, and advanced lock mechanisms, and have plans to give full breakdowns on when/where those mechanisms are used, and how they compare and contrast to each other.

You'll also find all C standard function definition listed in one of three files within the main directory:
`env.h`: stdlib, signal and setjmp

`iter.h`: stdio, stdint, stddef, stdarg, uchar, wchar, wctype, string, limits, inttypes, math, float, ctype, errno, time

`uniter.h`: unistd
